# React Redux Todo List App

## Overview

This Todo List app is a robust task management tool built with React, Redux, and Chakra UI. It allows users to effortlessly add, remove, edit, prioritize tasks, and toggle between completed or not completed status. Additionally, users can filter tasks based on priority or due date.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this project was twofold. Firstly, to deepen my understanding of state management in React applications, particularly with Redux and its evolution into Redux Toolkit. Secondly, to provide a practical example of Redux usage and best practices for fellow developers.

## Features

   * Add Task: Easily add new tasks to your list.
   * Remove Task: Remove tasks that are no longer needed.
   * Edit Task: Update task details such as title, description, priority, and due date.
   * Toggle Completion: Mark tasks as completed or not completed.
   * Filter Tasks: Filter tasks based on priority or due date.
